I am a fifth-year PhD student in computer science major at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, supervised by [Prof. Tarek Abdelzaher](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu). My research interests lie in applying deep learning techniques to Internet of Things (IoT) sensing applications, with a particular emphasis on motion, acoustic, and wireless signals. My recent research topics include IoT data augmentation via generative models, foundation models for IoT, and deep neural networks for signal processing. I expect to graduate in December 2024.

Research Interest
======
* **Generative AI for IoT**: generative data augmentation, diffusion models, domain knowledge-informed generation
* **Self-supervised learning for IoT**: contrastive learning, foundation models, multi-modality learning
* **Edge computing**: neural network based data compression, computation offloading


<!-- Educational Background
======
* PhD Student in Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, Sept.2019 -- Dec.2024 (expected)
* Master of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA, Sept.2017-- Dec.2018
* Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering Major, Sichuan University, China, Sept.2013--July 2017 -->

Experiences
======
* **Research Internship, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, (May.2023 - Aug.2023)**  
Worked on building the foundation model for inertial sensor signals. Conducted experiments demonstrating that pre-training on multiple large unlabeled datasets from various inertial sensing applications could benefit a downstream task from a different application. The results offered a promising methodology for training foundation models for inertial sensor signals under severe data scarcity.
